        <h1>Although Sri Lanka may be modest in size, nearly 30% of the land area is forest cover,
            and the island is sorrounded by the bio-diverse Indian ocean, which means there are a great 
            number of creatures both land-dwelling and ocean-dwelling in this country.
            While we can't cover all of Sri Lanka's animals both large and small, here are just a few of the top wildlife 
            attractions and where you can see them:</h1>

        <h2>Elephants</h2>
        <img src="Images/Fauna_elephant.webp" alt="Elephant" class="img">
             <br>
        <p class="text"> The largest of the four sub species of Asian elephants, the Sri Lankan Elephant once showed extensive wild
            population, inhabiting almost every part of the country, but now the numbers have declined drastically due to human activities 
            such as deforestration. both the male and female animals have tusks but the males have prominant ones, another reason that puts them
            in danger of ivory poachers. There are around 2000-2500 elephants in the wild, majority of which can be found in the dry and arid zones.
            <br>
            <br>
            For over two thousand years, elephants were a major element in local heraldry and remained through to even the British colonial rule. Even today, 
            many government institutions display the elephant on their coat of arms and insignia. As herbivores, Sri Lankan elephant diet mainly consists of leaves,
            grass, shoots, berries, barks, fruits, nuts and vegetables. The top places to find these majestic creatures are:<strong> Udawalawe National Park, Minneriya National
            Park,Yala National Park, Wilpattu National Park and Lunugamvehera National Park.</strong> </p>

        <h2>Leopards</h2>
        <img src="Images/Fauna_leopard.webp" alt="Leopard" class="img">
             <br>
        <p class="text"> Being mostly nocturnal animals and having excellent camourflage, leopards are nowhere near as easy to spot in the wild as elephants. However
            if you look really close you might find one resitng atop a tree in Yala, where they spend most of their time. These creatures prefer to hunt alone except 
            in mating period where the mother and her cubs can be encountered in the wild. The average weight of a male is 170lb and the femlae is close to 70lb. The 
            Sri Lankan subspecies of leopards are in fact the largest subspecies of leopards in the world.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some of the major reasons for the rapid decline in the population of leopards are due to habitat loss and hunting. These animals can be found around the island,
            with their distribution occuring in protected areas like isolated forest patches, national parks and hill country.It is pragmatic in its choice of diet, which includes 
            reptiles, small and large mammals as well as birds. The main sites where you can go to find these beautiful animals are <strong> Yala National Park and Wilpattu National 
            Park. </strong></p>

        <h2>Blue Whales</h2>
        <img src="Images/Fauna_bluewhale.webp" alt="Leopard" class="img">
             <br>
        <p class="text"> Blue whales are by far the largest and heaviest of all animals ever to have lived on Earth. the columnar of this gentle giant can reach up to 30 feet.
            Its graceful traingular dorsal fins help the blue whale to dive hundreds of miles into the deep ocean, where it feeds on small prawn like creatures callled krill, 
            eating up to two tons of krill a day. Sri Lanka's location, marine topography with deep ocean canyons and trenches, together with the hospitable weather system has 
            created a natural habitat for these massive animals. 
            <br>
            <br>
           During the seasons of winter and autumn, these mighty cetaceans make distant migrations from the rather temperate zones and into the warmer tropical waters to breed,
            however many believe Sri Lanka has its own resident pods of Blue Whale, which cam be found around the waters of the island throughout any time of the year. If you want to
            catch a good glimpse of these mighty mammals, you'll have to go to the <strong> coast of Mirissa between December and March, and the coast of Trincomalee between March and 
            July</strong></p>

        <h2>Sloth Bears</h2>
        <img src="Images/Fauna_slothbear.webp" alt="Leopard" class="img">
             <br>
        <p class="text"> Looking like a homeless man who hasn't showered in a decade, the shaggy, untidy and dusty black coat is an unmistakable sign to spot the sloth bear. Mainly 
            found in the dry zone regions, this animal is mostly solitary by nature. After about seven months of gestation period, sloth bears usually give birth to a litter of two 
            offspring inside the safety of an underground or rocky den. The cubs then cling on to the fur of the mothers back for the next couple of months, which is in fact a unique 
            trait among the Ursidae family.
            <br>
            <br>
            
           Being agile climbers, Sloth bears love to spend a considerable amount of their time on Palu trees during the season of where the tiny, sweet palu fruits come out in full bloom.
           These animals also can be frequently seen using thier sharp claws to dig out ant hills and termite mounds, or rotting stumps to find insects. It's not easy to spot them in the wild 
            due to their shy and reclusive nature, but you have a good chance of spotting one in <strong> Wilpattu National Park, Yala NAtional Park or Wasgomuwa National Park</strong></p>

        <h2>Sambar Deer</h2>
        <img src="Images/Fauna_sambardeer.webp" alt="Leopard" class="img">
             <br>
        <p class="text"> One of the largest deer that inhabit the southern parts of Asia, Sambar deer can be seen in large herds across forests and natural reserves in Sri Lanka. The Sambar Deer
            found in Sri Lanka is a sub species unique to the island known as <i> Rusa unicolor</i> and it pocesses quite large antlers relative to body size. Male animals weigh in about 270-280 kg 
            while female does are much smaller and less attractive in stature as always. These animals can be found mainly in lowland dry forest regions across the country, but in abundance in the 
            central and upcountry regions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Having a diet consisting of mainly leaves, grass, shoots and occasionally berries, Large herds of sambar deer roam the <strong> Horton Plains National Park </strong> throughout the year. British explorers
            and planters once mistakenly reffered to this animal as an elk, leading to place names such as <strong> Elk Plains.</strong></p>
