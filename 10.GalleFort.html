               <h5>Old Dutch fortifications</h5>
               <p>
                One of the most treasured historical monuments of Sri Lanka, Galle Dutch fort is located on the southern coast of the country. Amidst natural beauty with 
                lush green sorroundings and the spectacular view of the Galle beach, this fort displays age-old architecture and antiquity. At present time, the fort is still
                home to multi-ethnic and multi-religius population.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Inside the Dutch fort, there are many buildings which date back to the dutch rule of the country, with some of those properties still being owned by Dutch people.
                 Don't miss the Dutch Reformed Church, Historical mansion and most of all, a sunrise in Galle fort. It is something that shouldn't be missed at any cost as the scenic beauty 
                 of the sunrise over the pristine blue waters of the Indian Ocean will truly amaze you and the morning breeze will certainly rejuvenate your soul.

               <h5>A towering lighthouse</h5>
               <p>
                  Galle Lighthouse, also known as Pointe de Galle Light is a prominent tourist attraction of Galle. Built in 1939, this automated lighthouse is still in use as well as it serves
                  a perfect tourist spot for both locals as well as foreginers, who come from far and wide to view the beautiful scenery atop this lighthouse, which stands at 26.5 metres in height.
                  It was built to replace the old lighthouse which stood at its place but was destroyed in a fire in 1934.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                 Together with this lighthouse, visitors also have the opportunity to explore the Dutch fort, Dutch Reformed CHurch and Galle Fort Clock Tower which are located in the same vicinity.

               <h5>Sea turtle farm in Mahamodara</h5>
               <p> Mahamodara Sea Turtle Hatchery is located just a few minutes drive from Galle Fort, and this conservation centre is one of
                  many such hatcheries designated to breed and conserve turtles on the island, and like many others, its being run by volunteers.
                  During your visit to this turtle hatchery, these volunteers will explain the process of turtle breeding and you might even get the 
                  chance to touch these beautiful animals.
                  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Upon entering the premises, make sure you mindfully dispose of any plastic items or any other item which might be of threat to the turtles.
                  If the tour satisfies you, it is recommended to offer the centre a small donation in order to continue this noble cause in helping one of the world's
                  most endangered species. It is also possible to join the conservation as a volunteer and partake in its efforts to help turtles.
