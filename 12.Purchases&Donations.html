               <p> Sri Lanka, the home country to all these beautiful fauna, flora, beaches and historical monuments,
                   could really use your help, no mattter how small during this economically challenging time.
                Foundation of Goodness, Ghedora Connects, Reachout SL, Red Cross Sri Lanka are a few non-profit social service 
                organizations where you can extend your support.

               <p> Want to take a little something back home with you to remember your vacation in Sri Lanka? Make sure you get some
                   premium quality tea from Nuwara Eliya or some traditional masks from Kandy, our famous spices or even some coconut shell
                   kitchenware from shops across the country. They are not as costly as gems, jewelley or batik items and it also means a lot
                   to the local vendors.

               <img src="Images/Purchases_helpwildlifewebp.webp" alt="Help Wildlife"> 
               <p>Sri Lanka has 66 critically endagered and 102 endagered species according to IUCN's redlist databse. Little actions like using less
                   plastic during your travels, planting trees, volunteering for an organization or movement involved in Wildlife conservation will be of
                   tremendous help to the beautiful animals of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka Wildlife conservation Authority and Oceanswell are pioneering organizations
                   which you can extend your support to.
