        <h1>Whether you are in the vast Royal Botanical Gardens in Peradeniya, the Hakgala Gardens in Nuwara-eliya or the
            Mirijjawila Botanical Gardens in Hambantota, Sri Lanka has some unique and beautiful flowers which will definitely
            make you stop and have a closer look.

        <h2>Wild Lantana</h2>
        <img src="Images/Flora_wildlantana.webp" alt="Wild Lantana" class="img">
             <br>
        <p class="text"> Introduced to Sri Lanka in 1926, from South America, most likely the West Indies, this beautifully colored plant is now widely 
            distributed throughout the island. Wastelands, open areas, jungles, abandoned chena cultivation plots are some of the favourite spots where
            this plant likes to grow. Actually this plant is now considered as an invasive species and various government agencies are taking active measures
            to curb the population of this little stinker. Yes, if you do put your nose really close to it, it emits a slight pungent smell.
            <br>
            <br>
           This plant is capacble of producing ripe berries at seasons, which is a delicacy among bird and small mammal species. Providing nectar for butterflies
           is also one of the major contributions given by this plant. One of the key and most attractive features of Wild Lantana plant is that it's flowers come 
           in a wide range of colors such as pink-yellow, red-yellow, pink-orange etc. </p>

        <h2>Anthurium</h2>
        <img src="Images/Flora_anthurium.webp" alt="Anthurium" class="img">
             <br>
        <p class="text"> Anthurium is a flower renowned across the island for it's uniqueness, beauty and elegance. It mainly comes in white and red colors, while
            the pink variant is also gradually gaining popularity especially in home gardens. Many people love to buy these unusually shaped flowers, making Anthurium
            retail and wholesale a big business in Sri Lanka. This plant, unlike many other plants mentoned here, can be recognised at once due to its horn shaped flower.
            <br>
            <br>
            Anthurium plants manily propogate in two ways, sexual and asexual. Commercial salers engage in cross pollination with this plant frequently beacuse it is a faster
            and more efficent way to make new plants. Nevertheless anthuriums are one of the most versatile species of flora you can find on this island. An interesting fact is 
            anthurium plant takes two years to blossom when planted as seedlings. But if it is a vegetative propogated plant, then that will take only a single year to display those
            magnificent flowers</p>

        <h2>Binara</h2>
        <img src="Images/Flora_binara.webp" alt="Binara" class="img">
             <br>
        <p class="text">Mother nature displays her beauty in a wide variety of colors, but blue is an unusual color in nature. thats why the Binara, or Ginihirya as the local people
            call it, is one beautiful and special flower in this island. These flowers, which grow in plants upto one metre in height, are frequently offered for worship in Buddhist 
            temples and festivals, and is also used in local indegenious medical practices known as ayurveda.
            <br>
            <br>
            What makes this plant so special is that it was persumed to be extinct for over a century before being rediscovered and named as an endagered species.
            Blue Binara can sometimes be found in moist areas of the highlands and southern province, but its numbers are unfortunately on the decline. Sometimes you might also find dark
            blue or even purple and magenta vareities of this plant, though its even rarer than the blue variety.</p>

        <img src="Images/Flora_allamanda.webp" alt="Allamanda" class="img">
             <br>
        <p class="text"> A genus of flowering plants in the family of Apocynaceae, plants of the genus are evergreen trees, shrubs or vines. The flower blades are genrally oval and smooth edged 
            and is very soft to the touch. Known locally as kaha mal, or Wel rukaththana, this plant too is used in indigenous medical recipes. This plant is quite common in many parts of the island
            and can be easily spotted due to its bright yellow colored flowers which bloom in many seasons of the year.
            <br>
            <br>
            This plant, which can be easily grown in home gardens as well, has some useful propertues such as being used as a treatment for malria and jaundice. Allamanda plants produce a spinous, almost 
            globose fruit with 3-7 cm long capsules and 3-5cm long diam, seeds have a circular wing and are numerous.</p>

        <h2>Chrysanthemums</h2>
        <img src="Images/Flora_chrysanthemums.webp" alt="Chrysanthemums" class="img">
             <br>
        <p class="text"> Considered as one of the most popular cut flowers in many parts of the globe, mainly due to its vibrant colors and prolonged vase life, this flower is widely grown in Sri Lanka,
            mainly for commercial purposes. It as a favourite among horticulturists throughout beacuse there are so many varieties to choose from. It is a short day and long night plant, and being nocturnal,
            its flowers come out in full bloom during dusk and nightime. Commercial horticulturists provide artifical light, thus decieving this plant so that it keeps growing.
            <br>
            <br>
            Chrysanthemums can be grown either from cuttings or seeds, and because it is somewhat of a beginner freindly and low maintainance plant, it can be grown as a hobby in your home garden. In higher humid
            atmospheres, it is susceptible to 'White Rust' and other fungal infections such as 'Bothrites' and 'Downey Mildew'. It seems that these beautiful plants not only satisfy our eyes, but have the potential 
           to satisfy our taste buds as well, because Chrysanthemums are also used for culinary purposes, such as the making of chrysanthemum tea and also sometimesas a constituent of fine wine.</p>
