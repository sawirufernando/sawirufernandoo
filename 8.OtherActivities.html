          <h3>Take a walk through the upcountry tea plantations</h3>
          <img src="Images/Otheractivities_tea.webp" alt="Tea plantation" class="img">
          <p>During the period of British Colonization, tea was introduced and planted in the Royal Botanical Gardens. Twenty
              years later, commercial tea planting began in Kandy and slowly but gradually spread throughout the central hillside
              regions of the country and now Sri Lanka is lauded as the producer of the world's finest black tea.
              <br>
              <br>
              It is advised to allocate a whole day or at least half a day if you are planning to go visit the vast tea estates,
              mainly because of other activities you get to indulge in while you're at it, such as visiting a tea producing factory
              and tasting the wide variety of tea such as brown tea, black tea, herbal tea etc. It is best to take a guide along with 
              you, but is not completely necessary.
          </p>
            <p>A brief summary:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cost- (guide) LKR 1500-2500</li>
                <li>Distance from Colombo - 160km</li>
                <li>Duration - will take from half to a full day</li>
                <li>Other Details - If you're looking to stay the night nearby, there are plenty of pleasant bungalows around tea estates.</li>

            <h3>Surf the waves in Hikkaduwa</h3>
            <img src="Images/Otheractivities_surfing.webp" alt="Surfing" class="img">
            <p>Hikkaduwa might just be the most famous of all beach towns that dot the coastline of Sri Lanka's south-western shore. Sun-seekers,
                snorkelers and surfers alike have been drawn to this spot since the very first holidaymakers came the island's way in the late 70's
                What's special about Hikkaduwa is that there's a mix of moderately consistent and thrilling reef breaks for experienced surfers and 
                shallow, sad-bottomed waves for beginners too. 
                <br>
                Generally speaking, experienced surfers head off to the northern waters of Hikkaduwa while beginners surf the southern end, locally known
                as Narigama Beach. From Galle it takes only around 35 minutes to reach Hikkaduwa along the A2 main highway. There are muliple surfing spots
                in Hikkaduwa, namely, Main Reef, Owakanda, Narigama Beach and Benny's (named after guesthouse which stands next door).

                approximately 20% of the country's population. Historically, Colombo was a famous seaport, strategically located along the ancient East-West sea 
                trade routes and up to this day, the harbor of Colombo is one of the busiest ports in South Asia. After the era of British Colonial rule was over, 
                Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, a nearby suburb was made the administrstive capital of Sri Lanka but Colombo remains the commercial and financial capital 
                of the country.
                <br>
                <br>

                National Museum, Art Galley, Mount Lavania Beach, Independence Square, Dutch Hospital Shopping Precinct remain some of the major attractions here. You can
                go on a tour around Colombo in a tuk-tuk or on a bus, either way you are bound to have a time of your life.
