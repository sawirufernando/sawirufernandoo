                  <h5>A fascinating history</h5>
                  <p>
                    Sigirya, an iconic location in Sri Lanka, was inhabited for more than 4000 years, first being used as a monastery
                    and adter eight centuries, it was transformed into the royal fortress and palace of King Kasyapa, mainly because of its
                    strategic location and rugged terrain which made it almost impossible to invade, and invasion by his younger brother, king 
                    Moggallana was one of the worst fears Kasyapa had after he illegally claimed the throne in 495AD.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                     Sigiriya was constructed using the most advanced technology available at that time. After Maggallana finally defeated his brother in battle, he moved
                    the capital back to Anuradhapura and Sigirya became a Buddhist monastery before being abandoned again approximately thousand
                    years later.

                  <h5>Ancient frescoes</h5>
                  <p>
                     Painted on the western surface of the Sigiriya rock, these famous frescoes have been the subject of speculation by historical experts for nealry one thousand
                     siz hundred years. They, in turn, have remained silent, smiling enigmatically and keeping their secret intact up to this day. The names of the women displayed 
                     in the frescoes and the artist who painted them are lost to history. They were most probably women of the king's court dressed in their finest. Depicted as 
                     supernatural beings, they are portrayed with flowers to shower upon mortals beneath.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     Buddhist mythology speaks of <i>Alakamanda</i>, an exquisitely beautiful city amongst the clouds. This tale inspired king Kasyapa to instruct his finest painters and 
                     sculptors to decorate the rock, but having fallen afoul with the clergy previously, he chose a non-religious theme.

                  <h5>Astonishing architecture</h5>
                  <p>
                     An architectural marvel, this rock citadel was constructed in a way so that it rises up like a majestic lion, reaching nearly 200 metres. Although the upper body of the 
                     lion has fallen prey to time and is no longer visible, Sigirya is still a marvel look at. King Kasyapa even employed engineers from India to construct an underground reservoir that 
                     would remain filled even during the dry season. bridges, underground pumps, canal systems and ramparts, of which some are still visible and operational to this day were once part of Sigirya.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     The climb to the top of the hill is slow and ardous, but the view is totally worth the climb. The ruins of the erstwhile palace constructions-the royal throne, the queen's and king's quarters,
                     fountains and ponds can also be viewed.
